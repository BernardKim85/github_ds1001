# Git & GitHub Glossary

A comprehensive list of Git and GitHub terms every student should know. Terms are organized by category and difficulty level.

## üî§ Basic Terms (Start Here)

### Repository (Repo)
A folder that contains your project files and the complete history of all changes. Think of it as a "project folder with superpowers."

### Commit
A saved snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Like taking a photo of your project that you can always go back to.

### Staging Area (Index)
A preparation area where files wait before being committed. Files here are ready to be saved to the repository.

### Working Directory
The folder on your computer where you edit files. This is where you make changes before staging and committing them.

### Git
The version control system that tracks changes to your files over time.

### GitHub
A website that hosts Git repositories online, making it easy to share code and collaborate with others.

## üìÅ File and Change States

### Tracked
Files that Git knows about and is monitoring for changes.

### Untracked  
New files that Git doesn't know about yet. You need to `git add` them to start tracking.

### Modified
Files that have been changed since the last commit but aren't staged yet.

### Staged
Files that have been added to the staging area and are ready to be committed.

### Committed
Files that have been permanently saved to the repository with a commit.

### Clean Working Tree
When there are no changes to commit - everything is saved and up to date.

## üåø Branching Terms

### Branch
A parallel version of your project. Like creating a copy to work on features without affecting the main version.

### Main/Master Branch
The primary branch of your repository. Usually contains the stable, production-ready code.

### HEAD
A pointer that shows which commit you're currently on. Usually points to the latest commit on your current branch.

### Merge
Combining changes from one branch into another branch.

### Merge Conflict
When Git can't automatically combine changes from different branches because they modify the same parts of a file.

### Fast-Forward Merge
A merge where Git can simply move the branch pointer forward because there are no conflicting changes.

## üåê Remote Repository Terms

### Remote
A version of your repository that's stored somewhere else (like on GitHub).

### Origin
The default name for the main remote repository (usually where you cloned from).

### Clone
Making a complete copy of a repository from a remote source to your local computer.

### Fork
Creating your own copy of someone else's repository on GitHub.

### Push
Sending your local commits to a remote repository.

### Pull
Getting the latest changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local branch.

### Fetch
Downloading changes from a remote repository without merging them (like "check for updates").

## üîÑ Advanced Operations

### Rebase
Rewriting commit history by moving commits to a new base. Makes history cleaner but can be dangerous.

### Cherry-pick
Applying a specific commit from one branch to another branch.

### Stash
Temporarily saving your current changes without committing them.

### Reset
Moving your branch pointer to a different commit, potentially undoing changes.

### Revert
Creating a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit.

### Squash
Combining multiple commits into a single commit.

## üìä GitHub-Specific Terms

### Pull Request (PR)
A request to merge your changes into another branch or repository. Includes discussion and code review.

### Issue
A way to track bugs, feature requests, or other tasks in a GitHub repository.

### Release
A packaged version of your software at a specific point in time, often with version numbers.

### GitHub Pages
Free web hosting for static websites directly from your GitHub repository.

### Actions
GitHub's automation platform for running code, tests, and deployments.

### Gist
A simple way to share code snippets or small files on GitHub.

## üîß Command Categories

- `git checkout` / `git switch` - Change branches
- `git merge` - Combine branches

### Remote Commands
