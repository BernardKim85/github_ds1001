- **Team collaboration**: Multiple developers working on websites
- **Version control**: Tracking changes to design and content

## Extension Ideas 🚀

Once you complete the basic exercises, try these challenges:

1. **Add JavaScript**: Create an interactive feature
2. **Multiple themes**: Use branches for different color schemes
3. **Content management**: Practice adding/removing content
