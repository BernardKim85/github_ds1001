3. **Initialize Git** in the project directory
4. **Follow the project instructions** to practice specific Git skills

### For Group Practice:
1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Each team member clones** the fork
3. **Work on different features** simultaneously
4. **Practice collaboration** through pull requests

## Project Structure üóÇÔ∏è

Each project includes:
- `README.md` - Project overview and Git exercises
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step Git practice instructions
- Project files - Actual code/content to work with
- `SOLUTIONS.md` - Solutions to common problems (spoiler alert!)

## Getting Started üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Option 1: Copy to Practice Directory
```bash
# Navigate to your Git practice area
cd ~/git-practice

# Copy a sample project
cp -r /path/to/github_ds1001/sample-projects/personal-website ./my-website
cd my-website

# Initialize Git and start practicing
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Option 2: Fork and Clone
1. Fork this repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github_ds1001.git
   cd github_ds1001/sample-projects
   ```
3. Choose a project and start the exercises

## Practice Scenarios üé≠

### Scenario 1: Solo Developer
Practice the basics:
- Initialize repositories
- Make commits
- View history
- Create branches
- Merge changes

### Scenario 2: Team Collaboration
Simulate team work:
- Multiple people working on same project
- Feature branches
- Pull requests
- Code reviews
- Merge conflicts

### Scenario 3: Open Source Contribution
Learn open source workflows:
- Fork repositories
- Create feature branches
- Submit pull requests
- Respond to feedback

## Tips for Success üí°

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with the personal website project
2. **Read Instructions Carefully:** Each project has specific learning goals
3. **Don't Rush:** Take time to understand each Git command
4. **Experiment:** Try variations of the suggested commands
5. **Use Git Status:** Check `git status` frequently to understand what's happening
6. **Make Mistakes:** It's okay! Git makes it hard to lose data permanently

## Common Practice Patterns üîÑ

### The Basic Cycle:
```bash
# Make changes to files
# Check what changed
git status
git diff

# Stage changes
git add filename
# or git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Descriptive message"

# Repeat!
```

### The Branch Cycle:
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature-name

# Make changes and commits
# ... work work work ...

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Merge your feature
git merge feature-name
```
