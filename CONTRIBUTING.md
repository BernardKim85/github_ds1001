## üìã Style Guidelines

### For Tutorials and Documentation

**Writing Style:**
- Use clear, beginner-friendly language
- Include real-world examples and analogies
- Explain the "why" behind Git concepts, not just the "how"
- Use active voice when possible

**Formatting:**
- Use consistent heading levels (# for main titles, ## for sections)
- Include code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Use bullet points for lists and steps
- Add emojis sparingly for visual breaks

**Git Commands:**
- Show commands in code blocks: `git status`
- Include expected output when helpful
- Explain what each command does
- Provide context for when to use commands

### Example of Good Tutorial Content:

```markdown
## Understanding Git Status üìä

The `git status` command is like asking Git "What's happening in my repository right now?"

### When to use it:
- Before making commits (to see what will be included)
- When you're confused about the current state
- After making changes (to see what Git detected)

### Try it yourself:
```bash
git status
```

You should see output like:
```
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This means you're on the `main` branch and have no changes to commit.
```

### For Code Examples

**Sample Projects:**
- Use realistic but simple examples
- Include comments explaining key concepts
- Make sure all code works as expected
- Follow web standards for HTML/CSS

**Exercise Instructions:**
- Break complex tasks into small steps
- Include verification steps ("You should see...")
- Provide troubleshooting for common issues
- Add "Extra Credit" challenges for advanced learners

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Try the troubleshooting guide** first
3. **Test with a fresh repository** to isolate the problem
